                        The Basilisk is a mythological beast with the head of a bird of prey, the body of a serpent, and the wings of a dragon. Known as the king of serpents, it’s both guardian and symbol of the nexus of the watchmaking industry, the Swiss city of Basel.

                        The design of The Basilisk Collection by Chronspire was inspired by the famous Basilisk statues found throughout the city of Basel. From the ridged case in bare, or black DLC-clad titanium that’s reminiscent of the creature’s spine, to the articulated silicone strap or titanium bracelet which mimics the Basilisk’s sinuous body, to the green segmented GMT hand on the automatic version that looks like the beast’s tail.

                        And like the legendary beast, the watch is both tough and powerful, designed to stand the test of time.
